# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked to make a few changes to the PlanMyTrip app to take it to the new level. Here are the recommendations:

1. Adding the weather description to the weather data.
2. Let the beta testers input statements to filter the data for their weather preference.
3. The beta testers input will identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
4. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary.
5. Using the Google Maps API, a travel route will be created between the four cities, as well as a marker layer map.


## Resources
- Data Source: WeatherPy_Database.csv obtained through locating 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes.
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Pandas Dataframe 1.3.4, Google Maps API, Gmaps

## Results

- Using the random city generator, a vacation itinerary of the following cities were recommended:

1.) Vacation city start: Vidalia
2.) Vacation Stop 1: Dillon
3.) Vacation Stop 2: Wilmington
4.) Vacation city end: Havelock

- The beta version improvements were succesful!
